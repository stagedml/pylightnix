\section{Quick start}

We illustrate Pylightnix principles by showing how to use it as a Nix-like build
system. We will define two \textbf{stages} required to build
\href{https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/}{GNU Hello} application.

Note that despite using similar approaches, Pylightnix doesn't aim to be a
direct Nix replacement. It lacks many features you would probably expect of a
OS-level package management tool. It has no multiprocessing support neither it
has a build isolation. In contrast to Nix, Pylightnix is a bare-bone library you
could easily integrate into other packages to handle project-level data
management tasks.

\subsection{Defining a Stage}

The following Python function defines a Pylightnix \textbf{Stage} entity named
\texttt{stage\_fetch}. In its body we use a pre-defined \texttt{fetchurl}
finction which binds some name, URL, and the SHA256 hash string with a built-in
algorithm calling \texttt{Wget} and \texttt{Aunpack} tools to download GNU Hello
sources from the Internet.

\begin{pythontexcode}
from pylightnix import (Manager, DRef, RRef, fetchurl)

hello_version = '2.10'

def stage_fetch(m:Manager)->DRef: # DRef \label{DREF}
  return fetchurl(m,
    name='hello-src',
    url=f'http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-{hello_version}.tar.gz',
    sha256='31e066137a962676e89f69d1b65382de95a7ef7d914b8cb956f41ea72e0f516b')
\end{pythontexcode}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Indeed, Pylightnix stages are Python functions. By calling a stage
    function we register or \textbf{instantiate} this stage, that is, we bind
    some realization algorithm with its input arguments here called
    prerequisites.

  \item Stage function takes a dependency-resolution \textbf{Manager} context as
    its first arguments. The Manager holds the information about instantiated
    stages. Users normally shouldn't operate on Managers or call stage functions
    directly. Instead, they are to pass the top-level stage to one of Pylightnix
    top-level \texttt{instantiate-} functions.

  \item The return value of a stage function is a \textbf{derivation reference}.
    The primary role of derivation references is to introduce new dependencies
    between stages. By including a derivation reference of one stage into
    prerequisites of another stage we say that the second stage depends on the
    first stage.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Accessing the Data}

The primary method of accessing stage data is to call \texttt{realize} function,
passing the \texttt{instantiated} stage as its argument. Pylightnix either runs
the algorithm associated with a stage or re-uses existing realization. In both
cases, a \textbf{realization reference} handle is returned. We then use a
\texttt{Lens} helper which is a 'swiss army knife' for navigating through the
Pylihgtnix storage.

\begin{pythontexcode}
from pylightnix import instantiate, realize, mklens
from os.path import join, isdir

fetch_rref:RRef = realize(instantiate(stage_fetch))  # RRef \label{RREF}
print(fetch_rref)

print(mklens(fetch_rref).val)      # Interpret as Python value
print(mklens(fetch_rref).rref)     # Interpret as RRef (same result)
print(mklens(fetch_rref).dref)     # Interpret as DRef
print(mklens(fetch_rref).syspath)  # Interpret as a filesystem path
assert isdir(join(mklens(fetch_rref).syspath,
             f"hello-{hello_version}"))  # SRC \label{SRC}
print(mklens(fetch_rref).name.val) # Access prerequisite 'name' variable
                                   # and interpret it as a Python value
print(mklens(fetch_rref).url.val)  # Same for 'url' variable
print(mklens(fetch_rref).sha256.val)  # Same for 'sha256' variable
\end{pythontexcode}

Output:

\mysmallstdout

\begin{itemize}

  \item At line \ref{RREF} we \texttt{instantiate} and \texttt{realize} our
    custom stage to get its realization reference.

  \item Realization reference is a string identifier which could be converted to
    a local filesystem path within the storage. This path contains the sources
    of GNU Hello application. At line \ref{SRC} we check that this path is
    valid.

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\subsection{Defining a Custom Stage}

In this section we define a custom Pylightnix stage named \texttt{stage\_build}.
In its algoritm we provide instructions how to build the GNU Hello application
out of its sources.

\begin{pythontexcode}
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory
from shutil import copytree
from os import getcwd, chdir, system
from pylightnix import (Config, Path, Build, mkconfig, mkdrv,
  build_wrapper, match_only, dirrw, promise, build_setoutpaths)

def stage_build(m:Manager)->DRef:                            # ST \label{ST}
  def _config()->Config:                                     # CFG \label{CFG}
    name:str = 'hello-bin'
    fetch_ref:DRef = stage_fetch(m)                          # DEP \label{DEP}
    src:RefPath = [fetch_ref, f'hello-{hello_version}']      # RP1 \label{RP1}
    bin:RefPath = [promise, 'usr', 'bin', 'hello']           # RP2 \label{RP2}
    return mkconfig(locals())                                # LOC \label{LOC}
  def _realize(b:Build)->None:                               # RE \label{RE}
    build_setoutpaths(b,1)                                   # OP \label{OP}
    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
      copytree(mklens(b).src.syspath, join(tmp,'src'))       # LE \label{LE}
      dirrw(Path(join(tmp,'src')))
      cwd = getcwd()
      try:
        print(f"Building {mklens(b).name.val}")
        chdir(join(tmp,'src'))
        system(f'./configure --prefix=/usr')
        system(f'make')
        system(f'make install DESTDIR={mklens(b).syspath}')
      finally:
        chdir(cwd)
  return mkdrv(m, config=_config(),
                  matcher=match_only(),
                  realizer=build_wrapper(_realize))          # DRV \label{DRV}

build_rref:RRef = realize(instantiate(stage_build))
print(build_rref)
\end{pythontexcode}

Output:

\mysmallstdout

\begin{itemize}
  \item At line \ref{ST} we define a stage function.

  \item It is more convenient to start reading the stage code from the end.  At
    line \ref{DRV} we call the \textbf{mkdrv} stage constructor. The function
    has the following arguments:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Manager} utility object. Just pass the Manager we get from
        the stage function arguments.

      \item \textbf{Config} should be a dictionary-like object representing
        stage's prerequisites. Configs may only contain JSON-serializable
        fields, that is strings, numbers, booleans, lists or other dictionaries.

      \item \textbf{Matcher} function lets Pylightnix decide whether to run
        realizer or to re-use an existing object or objects.

      \item \textbf{Realizer} function knows how to create a new stage object
        out of prerequisites.

    \end{itemize}

    In this example we expect to get exactly one outcome. We use a simple
    \textbf{match\_only} matcher which ensures that our stage has only one
    realization.

  \item At line \ref{CFG} we define our stage's build prerequisites. For
    convenience we user a Python lifehack - call \texttt{local()} to convert
    local variables of \texttt{\_config()} into a dictionary.

  \item At line \ref{RP1} we define a \textbf{RefPath}, a path, relative to a
    stage realization folder. This particular path refers to a GNU hello source
    folder which we expect to see among \texttt{stage\_fetch}'s data.
    \texttt{mklens} knows how to convert such paths into a regulat system paths.

  \item At line \ref{RP2} we also define a \textbf{Promise Path}. Pylightnix
    will replace promise markers with a derivation reference of the stage
    being built and checks that said object does really exist in the filesystem.

  \item By mentioning derivation \texttt{fetch\_ref} at line \ref{DEP}, we say
    that \texttt{stage\_build} depends on \texttt{stage\_fetch}. Later we use
    this dependency at line \ref{LE} to access the \texttt{stage\_fetch}'s
    output data.

  \item With \texttt{mklens} we could explore dependencies in-depth. The
    definition at line \ref{DEP} allows us to read the parent's prerequisites as
    follows:

    \begin{pythontexcode}
    print(mklens(build_rref).fetch_ref.rref)
    print(mklens(build_rref).fetch_ref.url.val)
    \end{pythontexcode}

    Output:

    \mysmallstdout

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\subsection{Execute}

Finally, we locate the GNU Hello binary and run it.

\begin{pythontexcode}
from subprocess import run, PIPE
print(run([mklens(build_rref).bin.syspath], stdout=PIPE).stdout.decode('utf-8'))
\end{pythontexcode}

Output:

\mystdout

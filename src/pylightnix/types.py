#: RefPath is an alias for Python list (of strings). The first item of
#: `RefPath` is a [derivation reference](#pylightnix.types.DRef). Other
#: elements are to represent parts of file path.
#: RefPath is designed to be used in a stage config where they typically refer
#: to artifacts of already existing dependencies. To refer to future artifacts of
#: the derivation being configured, use
#: [PromisePaths](#pylightnix.types.PromisePath).
#:
#: To convert `RefPath` into a [system path](#pylightnix.types.Path), one
#: generally have to perform the following basic actions:
#:
#: 1. Dereference it's first item to obtain the realization. See
#:    [store_deref](#pylightnix.core.store_deref) or
#:    [build_deref](#pylightnix.core.build_deref).
#: 2. Convert the realization reference into system path with
#:    [rref2path](#pylightnix.core.rref2path)
#: 3.  Join the system path with `[1:]` part of RefPath to get the real filename.
#:
#: The algorithm described above is implemented as
#: [build_path](#pylightnix.core.build_path) helper function.
RefPath = List[Any]

#: *Do not change!*
#: A tag to mark the start of [PromisePaths](#pylightnix.types.PromisePath).
PYLIGHTNIX_PROMISE_TAG = "__promise__"

#: *Do not change!*
#: A tag to mark the start of [PromisePaths](#pylightnix.types.PromisePath). In
#: contrast to promises, Pylightnix doesn't check the claims
PYLIGHTNIX_CLAIM_TAG = "__claim__"

#: PromisePath is an alias for Python list of strings. The first item is a
#: special tag (the [promise](#pylightnix.core.promise) or the
#: [claim](#pylightnix.core.claim)) and the subsequent
#: items should represent a file or directory path parts. PromisePaths are
#: typically fields of [Configs](#pylightnix.types.Config). They represent
#: paths to the artifacts which we promise will be created by the derivation
#: being currently configured.
#:
#: PromisePaths do exist only at the time of instantiation. Pylightnix converts
#: them into [RefPath](#pylightnix.types.RefPath) before the realization
#: starts. Converted configs change their type to
#: [RConfig](#pylightnix.type.RConfig)
#:
#: Example:
#: ```python
#: from pylightnix import mkconfig, mkdrv, promise
#: def myconfig()->Config:
#:   name = "config-of-some-stage"
#:   promise_binary = [promise, 'usr','bin','hello']
#:   other_params = 42
#:   return mkconfig(locals())
#: dref=mkdrv(..., config=myconfig(), ...)
#: ```
PromisePath = List[Any]

#: Realization tag is a user-defined string without spaces and newline symbols.
#: By default, realizations have tag 'out'. This can be changed by realizer
#: e.g. to store logs, manual pages etc. separately.  The tag is supposed to be
#: unique across the [Group](#pylightnix.types.Group).
Tag = NewType('Tag', str)

#: Realization group allows users to distinguish between sets of
#: [tagged](#pylightnix.types.Tag) realizations.  For example, there may be
#: a group containing tags ['out',log'] and another group containing
#: realizations tagged with ['out','log','docs']. 'out' realizations are
#: pre-defined and are subject for matching with
#: [Matchers](#pylightnix.types.Matcher).
#:
#: By default, each realization is given its own unique group identifier
#:
#: Group invariants:
#: - At least one RRef in every Group
#: - All group refs have the same Context
#: - Any RRef belongs to exactly one group
Group = NewType('Group', str)

#: A group of tagged realization references. There should always be at least one
#: 'out' tag per group.
RRefGroup = Dict[Tag,RRef]

#: Context type is an alias for Python dict which maps
#: [DRefs](#pylightnix.types.DRef) into one or many
#: [RRefs](#pylightnix.types.RRef).
#:
#: For any derivation, Context stores a mapping from it's dependency's
#: derivations to realizations.
Context=Dict[DRef,List[RRef]]

#: Matcher is a type of user-defined functions which select required
#: realizations from the set of possible realizations.
#:
#: Matchers take a derivation reference and a context. They are to determine
#: the possible realizations (see [store_rrefs](#pylightnix.core.store_rrefs)
#: and return either a subset of this set or None which would be a signal to
#: Pylightnix to produce more realizations.
#:
#: When the matching is doen, Pylightnix updates the context with new
#: `(DRef,List[RRef])` pair and use it to e.g. resolve downstream realizations.
#:
#: Matchers should follow the below rules:
#:
#: - Matchers should be **pure**. It's output should depend only on the existing
#:   build artifacts of available realizations.
#: - Matchers should be **satisfiable** by realizers of their stages. If matcher
#:   returns None, the core calls realizer and re-run the matcher only once.
#:
#: Matchers may return an empty list and by that instruct Pylightnix to leave it's
#: derivation without realizations.
#:
#: Pylightnix provides a set of built-in matchers:
#:
#: - [match](#pylightnix.core.match) is a generic matcher with rich sorting and
#:   filtering API.
#: - [match_n](#pylightnix.core.match_n) is it's version for fixed number of matches
#: - [match_best](#pylightnix.core.match_best) decision is made based on a named
#:   build artifact
#: - [match_all](#pylightnix.core.match_all) matches any number of realizations, including zero.
#: - [match_some](#pylightnix.core.match_some) matches any existing realizations
#: - [match_only](#pylightnix.core.match_only) matches exactly one existing
#:   realization (asserts if there are more than one realizations)
Matcher = Callable[[DRef,Context],Optional[List[RRefGroup]]]

RealizeArg=Dict[str,Any]

#: Realizer is a type of callback functions which are defined by the user.
#: Realizers should implement the stage-specific
#: [realization](#pylightnix.core.realize) algorithm.
#:
#: Realizer accepts the following arguments:
#:
#: - [Reference to a Derivation](#pylightnix.types.DRef) being build
#: - [Context](#pylightnix.types.Context) encoding the results of dependency
#:   resolution.
#:
#: `DRef` and `Context` allows programmer to access
#: [Configs](#pylightnix.types.Config) of the current derivation and all it's
#: dependencies.
#:
#: Realizers have to return one or many folder paths of realization artifacts
#: (files and folders containing stage-specific data). Those folders will be
#: added to the pool of Realizations of the current derivation.
#: [Matcher](#pylightnix.types.Matcher) will be called to pick some subset of
#: existing realizations. The chosen subset will eventually appear in the
#: Contexts of downstream derivations.
#:
#: Most of the stages defined in Pylightnix use simplified realizer's API
#: provided by the [Build](#pylightnix.types.Build) helper class. The
#: [build_wrapper](#pylightnix.core.build_wrapper) function converts realizers
#: back to standard format.
#:
#: Example:
#:
#: ```python
#: def mystage(m:Manager)->DRef:
#:   def _realize(dref:DRef, context:Context)->List[Path]:
#:     b=mkbuild(dref, context, buildtime=buildtime)
#:     with open(join(build_outpath(b),'artifact'),'w') as f:
#:       f.write('chickenpoop\n')
#:     return [build_outpath(b)]
#:   ...
#:   return mkdrv(m, ...,  _realize)
#: ```

#: * And how to find best [match](#pylightnix.types.Matcher) among possible
#:   multiple realizations.
#:
#: Information is stored partly on disk (in the Pylightnix storage), partly in
#: memory in form of Python code.
#:
#: Derivations normally appear as a result of [mkdrv](#pylightnix.core.mkdrv)

#: Closure is a named tuple, containing a reference to target

#: `derivations` of a valid Closure contains complete (but not nesessary
#: minimal) collection of dependencies of it's target derivation `dref`.
#:
#: Closure is typically obtained as a result of the
#: [instantiate](#pylightnix.core.instantiate) and is typically consumed by the
#: call to [realizeMany](#pylightnix.core.realizeMany) or it's analogs.

class Config:
  """ Config is a JSON-serializable set of user-defined attributes of Pylightnix
  node. Typically, configs should determine node's realization process.

  Configs should match the requirements of `assert_valid_config`. Typically,
  it's `val` dictionary should contain JSON-serializable types only: strings,
  string aliases such as [DRefs](#pylightnix.types.DRef), bools, ints, floats,
  lists or other dicts. No bytes, `numpy.float32` or lambdas are allowed. Tuples
  are also forbidden because they are not preserved (decoded into lists).

  Some fields of a config have a special meaning for Pylightnix:

  * The field named `name` should be a short readable name. It is used to name
    the Derivation. See `assert_valid_name`.
  * Fields of type [RefPath](#pylightnix.types.RefPath) represent the paths to
    the dependency' artifacts
  * Fields of type [PromisePath](#pylightnix.types.PromisePath) represent
    future paths which are to be produced during the current stage's realization.
  * Values of type [DRef](#pylightnix.types.DRef) encode dependencies.
    Pylightnix scans configs to collect such values and plan the order of
    realizaitons.
  * Values of type [RRef](#pylightnix.types.RRef) lead to warning. Placing such
    values into a config is probably an error: Pylightnix doesn't have a chance to
    know how to produce exactly this reference so it can't produce a continuous
    realization plan.

  ```python
  def mystage(m:Manager)->Dref:
